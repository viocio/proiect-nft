This projects aims to create an app in which the user acceses a site and can intercat with a smart contract. By interacting with it trough the frontend, the user can send cryptocurrencies to the contract's address, and if enough balance is stored, retrieve a ticket to a concert (or any other event) that is actually an NFT.
